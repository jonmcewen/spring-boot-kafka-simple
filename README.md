## Note

* The example projects make use of the [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) plugin. To get proper code navigation in your IDE, you must install it separately.
Lombok is available in the IntelliJ plugins repository and as a [download](https://projectlombok.org/download) for Eclipse-based IDEs.
